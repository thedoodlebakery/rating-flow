## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid



### What I learned

This project allowed me to get more practice with Javascript and DOM manipulation. 


### Continued development

I want to continue learning how to manipulate the DOM and the classList in order to figure out the limitations and the benefits of using this method. 


### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - Various threads helped me refine the DOM manipulation.

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - Various articles on the platform assisted me with working the DOM manipulation. 

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList/) - Documentation around the site and this linked page assisted me with figuring out methods to manipulate the DOM in this project.
